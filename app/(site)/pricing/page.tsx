  {
    q: "Is there a free trial?",
    a: "Yes every plan includes a 14 day free trial with full access. We ask for a card at signup so billing can start automatically after the trial, but you are not charged during the trial and you can cancel any time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I switch plans later?",
    a: "Absolutely. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time from inside Restenzo. Billing is automatically prorated.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer discounts for yearly billing?",
    a: "Yes. Choosing yearly billing saves you 20% compared to monthly billing across all paid plans.",
  },
  {
    q: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    a: "All major credit cards via our Stripe integration. For Enterprise plans we also support ACH and invoicing.",
  },
  {
    q: "How many branches does the Multi Branch plan include?",
    a: "Up to 10 branches are included. Need more? Our Enterprise plan scales to unlimited branches with dedicated support.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer onboarding and data migration?",
    a: "Yes every paid plan includes guided onboarding. Enterprise customers get white glove migration from their existing system.",
